# Falling Sand Simulation
This project is a simple falling sand simulation implemented in React + Typescript. The simulation usees a 2d grid and allows users to interact with a grid of particles that fall under the influence of gravity. The simulation will update in real-time.

I created this project to learn React and Typescript.

This project is not optimized for performance (it performes faster then the gif).
